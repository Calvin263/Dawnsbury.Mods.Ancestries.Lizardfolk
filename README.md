Lizardfolk Ancestry for Dawnsbury Days

A small mod for the Lizardfolk Ancestry.

**Implemented:**
- *Ancestries*
  - Frilled Lizardfolk
    - Fire Resistance
  - Sandscale Lizardfolk
    - Intimidating Glare*
    - Threatening Approach*
- *General Feats*
  - Breath Control*
- *Ancestry Feats*
  - Razor Claw
  - Sharp Fangs
  - Tail Whip
  - Lightning Tongue*

**Differences from RAW:**
- Breath Control (given to all Lizardfolks) has no way of determining what is an "inhaled" effect. Thusly, the effects are simply applied to all poisons instead.
- Frilled Lizardfolk just grants Intimidating Glare. You should normally be able to choose whether it has the auditory or visual trait instead.
- Threatening Approach (From Frilled Lizardfolk) lets you stride wherever as opposed to specifically next to an enemy.
- Lightning Tongue will not let you pick up a two-handed item with one hand, to later add a hand onto it. Instead, you will only pick up the two-handed item if both your hands are empty. As normal, if you are unable to pick up the item with Lightning Tongue, it will be moved into your tile instead.
