Lizardfolk Ancestry for Dawnsbury Days

A small mod for the Lizardfolk Ancestry.
Only implemented Sandscale Lizardfolk and Frilled Lizardfolk.
There are a few differences from RAW: 
- Threatening Approach (From Frilled Lizardfolk) lets you stride wherever as opposed to specifically next to an enemy.
- Frilled Lizardfolk just grants Intimidating Glare. You should normally be able to choose whether it has the auditory or visual trait instead.
- Breath Control (given to all Lizardfolks) has no way of determining what is an "inhaled" effect. Thusly, the effects are simply applied to all poisons instead.

Technical stuff:
There's no easy way to add traits to the game, so I took the "Starborn" trait to represent Lizardfolk, which isn't in the game.
